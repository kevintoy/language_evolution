# language_evolution (updated 10/05/2022)
Greetings! There are three files here. "Raw_data_updated" contains the individual level data regarding whether the most inclusive label (that one could come up with) contains MAMMAL, BIRD, and/or WUG. This information is stored in a separate column “most_inclusive_label”, with values M, MB, or MBW. Another column “religion_or_education” contains binary information regarding whether the language spoken by the individual is influenced by religion or formal education (1 for Lisu in Fugong and Mandarin speakers, 0 for all other individuals). Demographic variables "education" and "age" are both in years. 
The "variation_on_animal_updated" file contains tallied counts of the values of "most_inclusive_label", grouped by languages. These data are used to make Figure 3 in the manuscript.
The "population level data" file contains additional information of different ethno-linguistic groups. Note that not there's a lot of missing information here and not all languages are used in the analysis of this project.
